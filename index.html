{% capture what_does_it_do %}<p>
	Oscilloscope Online is a powerful, completely free, web-based graphing and oscilloscope tool crafted to make data visualization fast, intuitive, and accessible to everyone. Whether you're a student exploring math functions, an embedded developer monitoring sensor data, a researcher analyzing survey results, or a musician visualizing audio waveforms, it turns raw numbers into beautiful, interactive graphs in seconds. It supports a wide variety of input methods — from simple mathematical expressions and manual tables to real-time serial data, microphone/audio files, Google Forms responses, and even custom JavaScript code running in the background — all with a clean, modern interface that works instantly in any browser.

{% capture how_does_it_work %}<p>
	The site is built with Jekyll, a static site generator that lets me update and deploy new features quickly and reliably without managing servers. The entire user interface is styled using Tailwind CSS combined with DaisyUI, giving it a sleek, responsive, and highly customizable look across phones, tablets, and desktops. All interactive plotting, data processing, and real-time visualization logic is written in TypeScript and runs completely in your browser — no data ever leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to save it (for example, to your own Google Drive). This client-side approach ensures maximum speed, privacy, and offline capability where possible.
</p>{% endcapture %}
{% capture what_does_it_cost %}<p>
	Absolutely nothing — Oscilloscope Online is 100% free and open for everyone, forever. There are no paid tiers, no feature locks, no ads, and no subscriptions. Every plotter, tool, and export option is available to all users with no restrictions. I built this project to give back to the maker, education, and open-source communities, and it will always remain a gift with no strings attached.
</p>{% endcapture %}
{% capture how_secure_is_it %}<p>
	Because the site is completely static (generated by Jekyll and served as plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), there is no server-side code, no PHP, no Node.js backend, and no database that could ever be hacked or leak your information. All processing — from parsing serial data to running your custom JavaScript code — happens exclusively in your browser. Your data never travels to my server or any third party unless you deliberately connect your own Google account to save plots to your personal Google Drive (and even then, only you have access). This architecture makes it one of the safest ways to visualize sensitive or private data online.
